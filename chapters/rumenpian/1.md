It occurred to me that many people new to Steem and Steemit may not know much about me. I think it is time I introduce myself along with everyone else.


很多不熟悉Steem和Steemit的人可能不了解我，是时候介绍一下自己了。


1. The Silver Rule  银律


As someone who attempts to follow the silver rule, “Don’t do unto others what you don’t want others doing to you.”, I concluded that initiating violence against others is not an option. I know that I cannot remain rationally consistent while violating this rule.


银律指“不要对别人做你不希望别人对你做的事”。作为恪守银律之人，我从不会用暴力对待他人，因为一旦违反银律，我无法理性地与自己的行事方式保持一致。


The logical outcome of this belief is that using threats of violence to extort money from others for any purpose is something that is off of the table. This means taxes and everything taxes pays for is off the table. This means war and violent revolution is off the table, but that doesn’t mean I want to sit back and do nothing.


这种信念合乎逻辑的结果是：暴力威胁或敲诈他人的方式不能解决问题。这意味着用征税或用税款采购的方法不可能解决问题，意味着使用战争或暴力革命的办法也解决不了问题，但这并不意味着我只会袖手旁观。


2. Finding Free Market Solutions to Secure Life, Liberty, and Property

寻找自由市场的解决方案：安全的生命、自由和财产


About 5 years ago I came to a realization that the solution to the organized crime syndicate commonly referred to as government must be born from the free market. Furthermore, any free market alternative to government that is unable to free us from the current government will not be strong enough to prevent a new government from taking over.


五年前我认识到：解决有组织犯罪集团（常指government）的办法一定产自自由市场。而且，任何government的替代者都无法把我们从现在的government中解救出来，因为这样做只会导致新的government接管。


I also realized that the demand for life, liberty, and property is very high and anyone who could find a way to provide these things to the market could make a lot of money while making the world a much better place. It was at this point in time that I started looking for non-violent means of rendering violent forms of government powerless.


我也意识到，人性对生命、自由和财产的需求极高，任何能够找到办法把这些东西提供给市场的人都可以很赚钱，同时让世界变美好。正是此时，我开始寻找一种非暴力手段——能让暴力政府无能为力的方式。


3. Start with Currency 从货币开始


I recognized that money is the root of government power and that use of money is entirely voluntary. No one forces you to be paid in dollars. The initial solution was to adopt gold and silver. I researched it and discovered that others had tried that approach and been shut down by governments. Governments have the power to seize property anywhere in the world. It became clear that the free market would require a form of money that is not backed by physical property.


我认识到，金钱是政府权力的根源，金钱的使用完全是自愿的，没人强迫你用美元支付，最初解决办法是采用黄金和白银。我研究了它，发现有人试过这种方法，但被政府关停。政府有权力在世界任何地方夺取财产。很明显，自由市场将需要一种无需物质财产支持的货币形式。


I was attempting to engineer a digital currency when I discovered Bitcoin in early 2009. I instantly got involved with attempting to promote Bitcoin.


当我在2009年初发现比特币时，我试图设计一个数字货币，我立即参与了试图推广比特币的工作。


4. Divorce 离婚


Around this same time I was also going through a divorce. My divorce was precipitated as a result of my on-going enlightenment that my ex-wife found to be incompatible with her world view. I was changing and rejecting old beliefs such as my Christian upbringing. The hypocrisy of the church and its widespread support violations of the Silver Rule made associating with that crowd increasingly difficult.


大约在同一时间，我却正在操办离婚，这是由于我日益改变的信仰所致，前妻发现这与她的世界观不符。我原来笃信基督教，但伪善的教会虽然口头接受、但却肆意践踏着“银律”，使得我与他们日益疏离。


This process distracted me from Bitcoin, but also taught me some hard lessons. Attempting to follow my belief in voluntary dispute resolution, I convinced my ex-wife to use christian arbitration to divide our property and settle issues of custody and child support. This was a big mistake.


其间的过程不仅无法让我全身心投入比特币，而且给了我深刻的教训。我追求用自愿解决争议，于是说服前妻用基督教的仲裁方式来分割财产、解决抚养权以及抚养子女的问题，但这却铸成大错。


The arbitration ruling was somewhat balanced. I would have to pay insane spousal and child support, but she would have to live within 30 minutes or I would get custody. This ruling was supposed to be legally binding, but this is when I learned that the government owns our kids and parents have no authority to make binding decisions about custody.


仲裁结果从某种意义上说是平衡的。我不得不支付高到离谱的配偶赡养费和子女抚养费，但如果她不在30分钟内搬离，抚养权将归我。这个裁决应该有法律约束力，但这使我意识到：拥有我们孩子的其实是政府，而作为父母的我们，并没有权力做出有约束力的抚养权裁决。


My ex-wife didn’t like the outcome and challenged it in the government courts. This is where I learned how irrational and biased the court system can be. At the end of the day the courts claimed they were bound to enforce the spousal support as ordered by arbitrators, but were free to change the custody. This turned a balanced judgment by arbitrators into a complete loss and made me learn just how corrupt the entire process is.


前妻不喜欢判决结果，到法院申诉。这让我了解到法院系统是如何地不合理并且有偏见。最后，法院说他们必须按照仲裁员的命令强制我支付配偶赡养费，但可以自由改判监护权。这使得一个原本还算平衡的裁决，对我而言变成了一个彻底的损失，这让我知道整个过程有多腐败。


I realized I was a slave. I was compelled by the court to earn the salary of a software engineer regardless of any desire to start a business or change careers. My ex-wife was getting over half of my after-tax paycheck and I was forced to live with my parents because there was not enough left over to support an independent life. I was broke and near bankruptcy due to legal expenses incurred fighting for my kids for 2 years.


我意识到我是一个奴隶。作为一名软件工程师，我被法院强制要求赚取工资，不管是否有创业或改行的愿望。前妻获得我税后薪水的一半，我被迫搬去和父母同住，因为没有足够的费用用来独立生活。为支付两年来争夺孩子的法律费用，我已濒临破产。


There is nothing more painful than realizing that the mother of your children is willing to shoot and/or kill you unless you bend to her will. She may not do it directly, but, from my perspective, asking the government to do it on her behalf is just the same.


没有什么比认识到这件事更痛苦的了：你孩子的母亲要求你必须屈服于她的意愿，否则她就一枪崩了你。她可能不会直接这样做，但站在我的角度看来，要求政府代表她这样做是一样的。


5. Meditation 冥想


It was at the depth of this despair that I learned how to let go. Holding on to anger and resentment was only holding me back. I started meditating and learning who I really was. I learned the joy of living in the moment and not dwelling on my story and the injustice of it all. I had to let go of things I could not change and focus on what I can do. This experience gave me the strength to be calm in any storm.


在绝望的深处，我学会了放手，因为坚持愤怒和怨恨没有任何好处。我开始冥想，并且思考我是谁。我领悟到生活在当下的欢乐，而不是滞留在我所经历的一系列的不公正。我不得不放弃我无法改变的事情，专注于我的力所能及。这段经历让我学会了在任何风暴中保持冷静。


6. Renewed Commitment 新的使命


Not wanting to give up, I became more determined than ever to find a way to get justice. I started getting back into Bitcoin and attempting to figure out ways to organize society that did not depend upon violence. More specifically, I started looking for ways that everyone could work together to defend ourselves against this organized, family destroying, crime syndicate.


不愿放弃，我变得比以往任何时候都更有决心找到通往正义之路。我转身回到比特币，试图构建一种不依赖暴力的社会。更具体地说，我开始寻找一种方式，这种方式能让人们共同抵御各种暴力，比如：蓄意的家庭毁灭或有组织的犯罪集团。


At this time Bitcoin was having problems with governments shutting down exchanges and/or seizing their bank accounts. I realized that Bitcoin could die if we did not have a decentralized alternative to exchanges. This is when I started BitShares and invented BitUSD - the first trustless cryptocurrency pegged to the dollar.


此时，比特币遇到了一些问题。在政府关闭了交易所，并且冻结交易所的的银行账户。这让我想到：如果我们没有一个去中心化的交易所，比特币就可能消失。此时，我开始写比特股的代码，并且发明了BitUSD，BitUSD是第一个与美元挂钩的加密货币。


For the next 2 and a half years I systematically worked on solving the technological challenges necessary to bring blockchain technology to a level of maturity that could support a decentralized exchange. The resulting technology is known as Graphene and is what powers BitShares and Steem.


在接下来的两年半中，我系统地解决了一些关键技术挑战，把区块链技术提升到可支持去中心化交易的成熟水平。由此产生的技术称为“石墨烯”，比特股和Steem都得到过石墨烯技术的赋能。


7. Social Lessons 社会给我上的课


Years working on BitShares taught me a lot. I learned hard lessons in community building and economics. Over this same period of time the blockchain industry matured. Government regulations became clearer. Centralized exchanges have been accepted and are no longer in danger of being shut down. In other words, the problem I set out to solve became almost a non-issue.


在BitShares两三年的工作，教会我很多，我也学到了很多社区建设和经济学方面的东西。与此同时，区块链行业已经成熟，政府监管变得清晰，中心化的交易所也已被接受，不再有被关闭的危险。换句话说，我原来捋起袖子打算解决的问题，现在已不存在。


I also learned that my capitalist mindset was too short-sighted. I began to see how building a community around the selfish motives of earning income by charging fees on transactions limited adoption. I learned that “inflation” isn’t theft if it is done to compensate those who bring value. I learned that true theft is expecting people to work for free without getting a share in the product. This maturing perspective caused me to diverge from many of people who were originally attracted to BitShares.


我也认识到，我对资本的认知过于短视。我开始思考如何建立一个自利驱动的社区，比如通过收取手续费。我了解到，如果“通货膨胀”是为了补偿那些带来价值的人而做的，那就不是窃取。真正的窃取是期待人们免费生产产品、但却无法通过产品获得应有的回报。这种日益成熟的观点使我与众多BitShares的拥趸分道扬镳。


8. Starting Steem 启动Steem项目


I decided to take the lessons learned and create a new attempt at building an online community around my new values. These new values are based on the premise that everyone who brings value deserves a share. They include the idea that the value of the whole is much greater than the sum of the parts. They include the concept of not charging anyone who participates in our community, but rewarding everyone. They include the concept of long-term commitment rather than get-rich quick.


我决定吸取教训，并围绕我新的价值观建立一个在线社区。这些新的价值观基于这样一个前提，即每个带来价值的人都应该得到回报。这些新价值观包含以下三种理念：

第一，整体价值远大于部分之和；

第二，不向参与者索取任何东西，相反要奖励他们；

第三，关注长期贡献，而非快速致富。


9. The Future 未来


Going forward I hope to leverage the work here with Steem to build markets, insurance, mutural-aid societies, and justice systems that empower our community to disempower government. I believe that properly organized social pressures can be far more powerful than any standing army or government bureaucrat. Through blockchain technology we can organize ourselves and hopefully achieve our liberty.


展望未来，我希望能够在这里利用Steem来建立市场、保险、扶贫协会和司法系统，使我们的社区能够卸下政府权力。我相信合理组织的社会压力比任何常备军或政府官员都要强大得多。通过区块链技术，我们可以自我组织，实现自由。


Only by working together can we maximize the life, liberty, and property for all. Resorting to violence is a shortcut that can only destroy life, liberty and property. I am honored that so many of your are here and helping me realize this dream.


只有通过共同努力，才最大化我们的生命、自由和财富。诉诸暴力虽然是一种捷径，但这种捷径只能摧毁生命、自由或财富。我很荣幸能有这么多的人来帮助我实现这个梦想。

译者（汤强）的话：


读此文前，BM在译者眼里只是个养黑猫的屌屌程序员。


BM曾在网络论坛上和被中本聪撕过一次，但他没有选择回撕中本聪，而是基于他的价值观、独自一人发明出DPOS共识算法（戳此复习），写出Bitshare、Steemit以及EOS的主干代码，在暴力驱动的中心化世界面前，撕下了它的封面。


这是篇让译者不禁路转粉的文章，不是因为经历，也不是因为代码能力，而是因为BM终于发现了自己的使命，找到了Something bigger than himself。


茨威格说过：“一个人生命中最大的幸运，莫过于在他人年富力强时，发现了自己的使命。”


对于BM而言，代码能力是马达，EOS是车身，使命才是指南针。
